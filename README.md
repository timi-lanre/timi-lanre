👋 Hi, I'm Timi Lanre


👋 About Me
I'm a technology professional specializing in data engineering and product management. My background helps me create strong data systems while concentrating on user needs and business results.  
What sets me apart is that I don't just build data pipelines. I build data products that address real problems and deliver measurable business value.

🎯 What I'm Looking For
I'm looking for opportunities where I can use both my technical skills and product thinking:  

Senior Data Engineer roles that have an impact on products and involve working with different teams.  
Technical Product Manager positions that focus on data products and analytics.  
Data Product Manager roles that create user-friendly analytics experiences.  

My ideal environment includes companies developing data products, B2B SaaS with complex analytics needs, or teams where technical skills and product strategy meet.



🤝 Let's Connect
I'm always interested in discussing data engineering challenges, product strategy, or the overlap of technical and business issues.  
Reach out for:  

- Technical architecture discussions  
- Product strategy conversations  
- Data engineering mentorship  
- Collaboration opportunities  



💡 "The best data engineers understand the business. The best product managers understand the technology."
I believe in building at the intersection of both.
